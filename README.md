CITS3200-Project
================

A place to work on our CITS3200 group project.

In order to clone this repository, open up a folder in your Terminal and type:

    $ git clone https://github.com/OldManInternetz/CITS3200-Project.git

old_html contains the html, css, js etc from the Prototypes. Plantsuwa is the rails application.

If you're going to work on something, it might be good to create a new branch.

    $ git checkout -b <name of branch>
    
This will help us all work in parallel.

Once you've done some work, you can commit your change using:

    $ git commit -m "here is a message about what I did"

and finally push it to the server:

    $ git push
    
Then hopefully the update will be pushed to the github server and the thing will be updated.
