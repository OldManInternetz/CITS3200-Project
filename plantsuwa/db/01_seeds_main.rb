This species is usually located on slopes and hilltops where soils are never too wet.', additional_info: 'Named as Anigozanthos fuliginosa in 1847 by Sir William Hooker (1785-1865) (Foundation director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew), later being given its own genus, Macropidia in 1855 by James Drummond (1784-1863) and the British algologist William Harvey (who collected in WA during 1854-56). 
The name \'kangaroo paw\' (initally called \'kangaroo foot\') came into common use in the 1950s, and is used to describe many species of Anigozanthos and Macropidia fuliginosa. The prefix \'Black\' describing the flower colour associated with this species. 
Distributed from Muchea (north of Perth) north to Walkaway, in dispersed populations.', identification: 'Leaves are strap-like, grey or blue-green, 20-50cm long (sometimes more). Leaves are hairless and form flattened upright fans at the base of the plant. Flowers are yellowish-green though appear black due to both the stems and flowers being covered with dense black hairs. The floral stem produces a widely branched cluster of inflorescences. Flowers are unusual, clustered on large (to 1m) brached black stems. Flowers are tubular (perianths 5-6cm long, with tubes 1.2-1.8cm long) with petals deeply divided and highly reflexed (curling irregularly back onto the tube). 
Note that in the wild this species often produces 1- 5 floral stems in a flowering season, the common number for most species of kangaroo and catspaws. In cultivation this number is often increased greatly (10 fold), given favourable conditions. Commonly the inflorescence is many flowered, 5 - 15 flowers per inflorescence (producing between 10 to 100 flowers per season, note these are dramatically increased in cultivation). 
While most kangaroo paws have leaves and scapes (floral spikes) which die back post flowering, Macropidia has leaves which persist throughout the year. These plants will persist in the same spot for several years (note many other kangaroo paws being thought of as biennial due to their poor yearly regeneration). Rhizomes growing larger than most species to 5cm wide. 
Distinguished from the genus Anigozanthos by; the flower colour (black), the seed capsule which contains only 3 seeds (differing from Anigozanthos in which the fruit capsule will hold anywhere from 3 to 4 to 140 seeds). These seeds are larger (up to 5mm) than Anigozanthos species, with a prominent ridge on the inner surface. In addition, when the seed is released from the capsule Macropidia seed retains its attachment to part of the ovary wall, so black hairs can be seen. In Anigozanthos most species release their seed without any external attachment.', physical:'- Flax-like, green foliage.

The rhizome (tough, underground stem) common to most kangaroo paws, is buried 2-10cm below the soil surface allowing the plant to survive bushfires (sprouter). Also commonly seen occupying other disturbed areas (ie road verges).

Note that with regards to the inflorescence, only one or two flowers, open and function at any given moment (an evolutionarily advantageous trait to increase likelihood of successful pollination). Flowers opening from the bottom upward, with new flowers opening at night. Fresh flowers are thrust forward opening (usually) towards the scape (floral stem) on which pollinators (usually birds) sit. These flowers last for roughly 6 days then shrivel and rotate sideways, allowing the next flowers to open and face the stem. Pollinators are attracted to the brightly coloured flowers, being rewarded by often large quantities (170ul per flower per day) of sugar rich nectar (containing 5-20% sugar). As the animal (usually a bird) feasts on the nectar, pushing into the tubular perianth, it is dabbed by pollen coating the anthers. These sausage-shaped pollen grains remain viable for only a day, but will hopefully come into contact with the stigma of another flower and seed will be produced.

This species is highly successful in attractive pollinators (highly successful reproduction) being found to have 50-70% of flowers pollinated and setting seed.

This genus protects itself from predation by herbivors through the production of calcium oxalate crystal (sharp-needle like crystals). Clusters of these crystals (called raphides) are toxic to most animals', wildlife: 'Attracts:
- birds, honey-eaters  (the nectar produced during flowering attracts many honey-eating birds; including the New Holland, singing, brown, white-cheeked and tawny-crowned honey-eaters, silvereyes, weebills and red wattlebirds. While most of these species are successful pollinators, the silvereye and weebill (with their short bills) are known to cause flower damage in pursuit of nectar. Parrots such as the red-capped and Port-Lincoln parrot also destroy flowers, ripping them off the scape and crushing them to get at the nectar.)
- insects (flowering attracts an array of insect feeders; thrips, ants, bees, hairy catterpillars, long-horned grasshoppers. The european honey bee (Apis mellifera) theives nectar from the flowers and appears not to play a role in pollination (due to the large physical separation of the nectar site and the anthers and stigma). Often capitalising on damaged flowers caused by the silvereye and weebill (birds). The long-horned grasshoppers (Katydids) not only enjoy the feast of the flowers but also use the inflorescence as a site for mating.)
- mammals (flowering attracts marsupials; the honey-possum and western pygmy possum (small animals) which scamper up the floral spikes to drink the sugar rich nectar. Kangaroos (western grey) are also known to graze on the flowers, and often cause damage to plants by knocking down the scapes.)', architectural_info: '', characteristics: 'upright, clump forming, Perennial herbaceous shrub < 1m.', environment: '- full sun

Common being used as this species is the most common she-oak found in the lower south-west region of Western Australia.

Extending from Jurien Bay to Mt Manypeaks, Western Australia, inhabiting near coastal areas.', identification: 'This is the most widespread she-oak of the lower south-west of Western Australia. With good specimens seen in Kings Park.
Its growth habit changes with its location, ranging from an understorey tree up to 15m tall in the Jarrah forests of the Darling Range to a small tree on the Swan Coastal Plain. Specimens found growing near the coast show an open habit with foliage arranged into more horizontal layers, dead twigs (killed by salt) are curved and straight, creating an unusual but decorative effect.

Common she-oak has thick branches with dense clumps of foliage. Nodes on branchlets (needle-like foliage) numerous, 0.5-1.5cm apart, with 6-8 scale leaves at each node, teeth usually widely spreading and curved downwards. Dioecious plant. The male spikes (staminate flowers) are rich brown in colour, distinctly pedunculate, cylindric up to 12cm long, bracts in whorls of 6-8, mass over the tree in late winter or early spring (May-Oct). Flowering changes the trees overall colour from green to brown and causes foliage to droop. Female spike (pistillate flower) ovoid. Cones are globular to egg-shaped 1.5-3.5 x 1.5-3.5cm reddish-brown aging to grey, peduncle 0.5-1cm long, valves shortly prominent. Seed are 8-11mm long with a dark brown body with white flecks and a transparent colourless wing.

- fungal attack - a black smut fungus develops on the honey-dew caused by sap sucking bugs
- insect attack - Sap sucking bug lives in the twigs (its white fine hair-like protruding tube being the only part which extends out of the branchlet and is visible) eating the sap and exuding a honey-dew which makes banchlets sticky (attracting other insects, see wildlife). Severe attact from these sap sucking bugs may lead to distored hanging branches often called witches\' brooms. Native cockroaches, weevils and crickets eat the cladodes.

Collected near Perth by J.A.L. Preiss in 1839 and James Drummond in the mid 1800s.

Being naturally found from Kalbarri to Collie and east to near Kulin (Western Australia).', identification: 'One of the tallest species of the genus. Its habit varies from small (<3m) and globular (rounded) in open (or disturbed) sites, to being taller (4m) and less spreading in woodland environments. Recognised by its woolly grey-green or grey-blue foliage, young shoots are red-tinged. Leaves are overlapping, dense, and blade is 3-branched, i.e. highly divided into terete, linear segments (note the lateral lobes are 2-branched the central lobe is usually undivided, with ultimate divisions 5-7). Leaves and branchlets are covered in hair (pubescent), making them woolly to touch (branches often becoming glabrous). Leaves may have small, globular orange-brown tips (nectaries). The flowers are single or in small groups at the ends of brachlets, inconspicuous, small red and tubular looking, and are hidden within the foliage (unusual for Adenanthos). Peduncle ca 1mm long, flowers lack a basal bract, involucral bracts 5-8; calyx greenish 15-28mm long with short hairs, limb 2-3.5mm long, bearded inside behind each anther. All stamens are fertile. Ovary glabrous; style 26-37mm long, glabrous. Flowering is over much of the year.
There are two forms of A. cygnorum, both of which can be seen in the metropolitan region. A prostrate form (A. cygnorum subsp. A. chamaephyton) growing on lateritic soil near Mundaring, Chidlow, Muchea and Collie and the more common upright form (A. cygnorum subsp. A. cygnorum) which ranges from Kalbarri to Collie east to Kulin (common to the Perth metropolitan region). This species is easily confused with A. sericea another Woollybush which has finer, softer foliage, and is commonly cultivated throughout Perth, being the favoured species.', physical:'- Attractive, woolly grey, green foliage.

The production of nectaries at the ends of the highly divided linear leaves attract ants to the plant. This trait is thought to help in the minimisation of foliage predation by harmful insects. Most of these ant species (seventeen of which have been recorded) also remove the fruits, storing them in their nests. Such practice results in seed dispersal, with uneaten seed germinating later when brought to the soil surface due to some disturbance. Other animals which pick up seed from the ground such as rodents and the occassional seed-eating bird play only minor roles in seed dispersal.', wildlife: 'Attracts:

- low maintenance required. Usually frost resistant though young plants may need some kind of protection in their first winter.
- prune after flowering - Shrub forms require regular light annual pruning in the first few years - to help establish a dense bushy form. After this habit has been established pruning needs only be done every 3 to 4 years, to help maintain this shape. Not only does pruning help alter the shape and growth form it also stimulates flower production (encouraging extra flowering - within the season and twice-yearly flowering). To get the best floral displays prune the flowering head before it turns to seed (during the final days of flowering or immediately after flowering).
- cutting - short, leafy, semi-ripe tip cuttings taken in late summer and autumn. Note that cultivars must be propagated from cuttings to ensure the correct clonal features are maintained. Cuttings should be placed into a sand/peat mixture and kept in a cool, humid environment (with mist if possible). If difficulties arise in striking, a rooting hormone should be used.
- seed - propagate from seed in autumn or spring. Seed should be collected from the woody capsules near the base of the shrub, or closest to the trunk, to ensure seed is mature and viable. Capsules should be put into a paper bag and kept in a warm dry environment until the seed has been released. Seed should be sown in a friable medium and covered with fine peat and kept in a warm moist environment.

Endlicher, Professor of Botany and Director of the \'Botanical Gardens in Vienna\' in Germany in 1846. 
The name \'kangaroo paw\' (initally called \'kangaroo foot\') came into common use in the 1950s, and is used to describe many species of Anigozanthos and Macropidia fuliginosa. The prefix \'Green\' describing the flower colour associated with this species. 
Naturally occuring on the Swan Coastal Plain from Nambung National Park south to Scott River and Walpole.', identification: 'Grey-green leaves are terete (rounded in cross section) to 5 to 50cm long, 1-5mm wide. Flowers are a striking emerald green paw on a green woolly stem. Hairs on the stem may be red-brown. Floral spike (scape) usually to 40-50cm, as low as 10cm sometimes reaching 100cm, is unbranched (terminal inflorescence) and slightly curved near the flower head. The ovary and perianth are uniformly green, perianths are 5.5-7.5cm long with fully recurved lobes. 
Note that in the wild this species often produces 1- 5 floral stems in a flowering season, the common number for most species of kangaroo and catspaws. In cultivation this number is often increased greatly (10 fold), given favourable conditions. Commonly the inflorescence is many flowered, 5 - 15 flowers per inflorescence (producing between 10 to 100 flowers per season, note these are dramatically increased in cultivation). Flowering peaks in late winter and early spring. 
Three sub species exist. A. viridusssp. viridis (Common green kangaroo paw) being the tallest and most robust, flowering in September and October. A. viridusssp. terraspectans (Dwarf green kangaroo paw) a naturally endangered and rarely seen plant with floral spikes (scapes) 10-15cm, leaves 5-10cm long x 2mm wide. Confined to an area near Cataby, north of Perth, it is known to be a short-lived post-fire opportunist. Flowers opening away from the axis of the plant and are thrust outwards away from the scape. In cultivation it is admired for its compact habit and floriferous nature. Used in pots and rockeries. Flowering from August to October. A. viridusssp. \'metallica\' (Metallic green kangaroo paw) is found between Beermullah and Nambung National Park. Its floral spikes (scapes) are intermediate in height between Dwarf green kangaroo paw and Common green kangaroo paw, usually 15-30cm tall. It is similar to Dwarf green kangaroo paw in that its flowers open away from the axis of the plant. It can be separated from this sub species by its distinctive dark metallic green floral hairs and the fact that its flowers overhang the scape. Flowering August - September.

The rhizome (tough, underground stem) common to most kangaroo paws, is buried 2-10cm below the soil surface allowing the plant to survive bushfires (sprouter). Also commonly seen occupying other disturbed areas (ie road verges).

Note that with regards to the inflorescence, only one or two flowers, open and function at any given moment (an evolutionarily advantageous trait to increase likelihood of successful pollination). Flowers opening from the bottom upward, with new flowers opening at night. Fresh flowers are thrust forward opening (usually) towards the scape (floral stem) on which pollinators (usually birds) sit. These flowers last for roughly 6 days then shrivel and rotate sideways, allowing the next flowers to open and face the stem. Pollinators are attracted to the brightly coloured flowers, being rewarded by often large quantities of sugar rich nectar (containing 5-20% sugar). As the animal (usually a bird) feasts on the nectar, pushing into the tubular perianth, it is dabbed by pollen coating the anthers. These sausage-shaped pollen grains remain viable for only a day, but will hopefully come into contact with the stigma of another flower and seed will be produced.

This species is highly successful in attractive pollinators (highly successful reproduction) being found to have 50-70% of flowers pollinated and setting seed.

This genus protects itself from predation by herbivors through the production of calcium oxalate crystal (sharp-needle like crystals). Clusters of these crystals (called raphides) are toxic to most animals', wildlife: 'Attracts:
- birds, honey-eaters (the nectar produced during flowering attracts many honey-eating birds; including the New Holland, singing, brown, white-cheeked and tawny-crowned honey-eaters, silvereyes, weebills and red wattlebirds. While most of these species are successful pollinators, the silvereye and weebill (with their short bills) are known to cause flower damage in pursuit of nectar. Parrots such as the red-capped and Port-Lincoln parrot also destroy flowers, ripping them off the scape and crushing them to get at the nectar.)
- insects (flowering attracts an array of insect feeders; thrips, ants, bees, hairy catterpillars, long-horned grasshoppers. The european honey bee (Apis mellifera) theives nectar from the flowers and appears not to play a role in pollination (due to the large physical separation of the nectar site and the anthers and stigma). Often capitalising on damaged flowers caused by the silvereye and weebill (birds). The long-horned grasshoppers (Katydids) not only enjoy the feast of the flowers but also use the inflorescence as a site for mating.)
- mammals (flowering attracts marsupials; the honey-possum and western pygmy possum (small animals) which scamper up the floral spikes to drink the sugar rich nectar.

B. cuneata is a related species with smaller leaves and flowers and smooth bark. 
The progressive colour changes of the flower-spike are likely to enhance pollination via; a) The older pink and red flowers providing a visual attraction to the main pollinators (honey-eating birds), while it is the yellow-cream flowers which contain the major supply of nectar and pollen for the birds and insects to feed upon. b) It has also been postulated that colour changes relating to pollination lets animals know which flowers to visit in order to feed without wasting time. It is important for B. ilicifolia to be an efficient pollinator as it has much competition with other associated Perth banksias which flower over shorter periods with intense floral displays. In addition its flower-clusters are relatively small and are scattered or in low abundance. 
Seed is generally intact due to its quick maturation (see propagation) and is therefore less likely to be attacked by insects.

Today Jarrah\'s inland boundary is determined by the annual 600mm isohyet.', identification: 'It is the most widespread tree of the coastal plain around Perth, occuring as a smaller more branching tree to 15m, and is less common but still frequently seen on the clayey soils on the Darling Scarp, where it is a taller forest tree. It can be seen as a mallee on slopes of the Stirling Range and on Mount Lesueur. 
Adult leaves are glossy dark green above and dull pale green below, with a distinct leaf margin. Note that this two sided leaf form is common of specimens growing on the coastal plain and in the lower south-west, whereas leaf colour on the Darling Plateau (notably to the north and on the Dandaragan Plateau) are more blue-green. The blue-leaved form having much the same colour on both sides of the leaves. The cylindrical buds have a long conical bud cap, longer than the floral tube. Major reproductive growth is in summer when the flower buds are produced in the axils of new leaves. Some buds are shed from year to year with those retained developing strongly the following spring, when they can be seen as yellow or orange patches in the foliage, flowering in spring and summer. Flowering occurs before summer leaf-growth and so allow the flowers to be well displayed along the ends of the twigs. Fertilised flowers mature a year later and form mature fruit. The fruits are rounded or globular to barrel or cup-shaped, 12-15 x 12-15mm. Heavy budding and fruiting is often at the expense of leaf production resulting in thin crowns after the older leaves have been shed. Foliage thickens again once the fruits have matured. Seed is lustrous or matt, black, pyramidal, with kidney shaped seed-leaves.

If overshadowed it will be slow growing, otherwise it develops strongly.
- low maintenance required. Usually frost resistant
- seed - can be collected year round, establishment best from seedlings
- insect attack - often the foliage turns brown in spring due to the jarrah leaf-miner larvae which eats the tissue between the outer layers of the leaf, leaving reddish brown patches. It also makes small oval-shaped holes. The mature larva cuts out the outer leaf layers and cements them together to form a sac, in which it falls to the ground. It then burrows into a crack to pupate. The tree recovers by producing a fresh summer crop of leaves. Other pests include; the red-legged weevil, and sawfly larvea - commonly known as \'spitfires\'.
Phytophthora cinnamomi (dieback)

It is cultivated in King\'s Park, Perth, but does not appear to be grown in other States.', architectural_uses: '', culture: 'Jarrah is easily the most famous Perth eucalypt, being renowed for its hardwood qualities it is the principal timber tree of Western Australia. The timber is beautifully grained, rosy-red, strong and hard but easily worked. It is also durable and fairly fire-resistant. Many famous roads in cities such as London and Berlin were paved with jarrah blocks, prior to the use of bitumen and concrete. Today however the timber is used for high-quality wooden furniture. 
Aboriginies used it for making spear-throwers. 
During good flowering seasons, jarrah provides ample highly nutritious pollen for honey production and maintenance of bee colonies. Jarrah honey being a medium-amber colour with a nutty-flavour.', conservation: 'The Jarrah forest is regarded as one of the world\'s most unique forest ecosystems. 
Jarrah is abundant on the Darling Plateau where it makes up a large amount of the State Forest. It is generally cut for timber purposes and so most specimens are slender in appearance due to regrowth. Old specimens from virgin forests showing more height and and thickness. A few exceptionally large specimens exist, up to 500 years of age, 50m in height, 3-4m in trunk diameter. The growth pattern of jarrah (in forests) on laterite soils is quite determined due to their competion for light and nutrients. Jarrah often passing through regular stages of growth; from a low shrub with many branches originating from the lignotuber (swelling at their base) to a small sapling with a distinct crown, to the \'pole stage\' when the larger lower branches are retained for some time before being shed, to a slender tall tree encompassing the \'pile\' stage when the tree begins to form branches that will persist. This habit is not maintained on the coastal plain however where jarrah is largely free from environmental growth restrictions, being associated with banksias and sheoaks, hence each tree has an individual form. 
The well known disease Phytophthora cinnamomi \'dieback\' (believed to evolved in south-east Asia) affects the jarrah forest of the Darling Plateau. Attacking the root systems of trees and shrubs, killing certain susceptible species. Jarrah is susceptible when on the poorly nourished laterite soils and dies within years (especially within the low-lying areas of the forest). The commonly seen, dead open crowns, littering the skyline. It was estimated that 282, 000 ha of forest had already been affected by dieback disease by 1974, and that rates of increase were estimated to be 20, 000 ha per annum.

Collected by Robert Brown in 1801 at King George Sound.

Being naturally found predominantly in the lower south-west, Western Australia. It extends east to Cape Riche (east of Albany) and northwards to Mt Lesueur near Jurien Bay. Outlying populations exist near the Hill River. Its distribution being more restricted than Xanthorrhoea preissii (Grass trees).', identification: 'Visually quite similar to Xanthorrhoes preissii, also an arborescent monocot. Though it can be distinguished by; its multiple flowering stems which are much shorter than those of X. preissii, leaves are slightly flatter and are drumstick-like in shape (rounded floral head on the spike), the trunk (or caudex) is straight an rarely branched. If the trunk is branched this indicates that the growth tip was probably damaged.
The leaves which radiate from the top of the stem create a \'fan\' appearance, when young they stand erect but with age they start to droop down, dying and curving in to give the tree a skirt-like look (partially covering a section of the trunk). Leaves are silky bluish-green up to 2m long, when pulled out they have a broad leaf base up to 2.5cm wide. Note that the leaves vary in their \'hairyness\', with the leaf bases being distinctly silky-hairy. The \'drumstick\' or \'globe artichoke-like\' inflorescense consists of a pom-pom like flowerhead (head diameter 4-7cm) on the tip of a stout peduncle (30-40cm long), the peduncle is pale green and covered with silky bracts (giving it a scaly appearance). The spike is bright yellow-green when young, browing with age and drooping down into the old leaves which make the \'skirt-like\' appearance around the top part of the stem. The production of inflorescences can be quite varied with 2/3rds of plants producing a few infloresences in any one growing season, while up to 100 may be produced after a fire event. Flowering is in winter. The trunk is around 30-38cm wide.

Multiple inflorescences are produced from just below the growing shoot of the plant. This means that vegetative growth is generally maintained in an upward direction, causing the plant to have a very straight trunk.', physical:'- Attractive, silky bluish-, green foliage.
- Showing a moderate display of large, 30 - 40cm wide, yellow, drumstick shaped flower-spike flowers. Flowers during June - August [winter].
- The trunk is generally black, caused by charring from fire. It is comprised of flat leaf bases which are packed in closely compressed spirals (cemented with resin), inside this is a fibrous central core (vascular)(note this plant is a monocot). The wood at the base of the core is very dense, with waves., noted for its attrative trunk.', horticulture: '- Note that this species has hermaphroditic flowers, pollination being done by insects.

rockery plan', culture: 'Europeans used Kingia trunks to make barn, stable and shed floors. The timber known to be resistant to termites. As dried Blackboys (shiny, leaf bases) were used as a fuel source, mostly for kindling, in Western Australia, it is highly likely that Kingia were used in a similar manner. Blackboy timber is also used by craftsmen, making an unusual but beautiful media to create vases, bowls and lamp bases. Perhaps Kingia timber is also used in a similar way.
Resin properties of Kingia are not documented, it is of interest however that early Europeans used gum exuded from the trunk of Xanthorrhoea preissii (the Grass tree) to make varnish. This resin was found to be soluble in alcohol and ether but not in turpentine, and when fractured showed a rich ruby or chrome-orange colour. It was used mainly to colour varnishes which were used to imitate cedar. Resin was also once harvested as a source of picric acid.

It seems likely that many of the uses of Xanthorrhoea by Aborigines may be relevant to Kingia (this is purely an assumption). These include; 
The floral spikes were soaked in water to create a sugar rich drink (some being alcoholic). 
The bases of the inner most (youngest) leaves were eaten (raw or roasted), the tender white shoots having a nutty flavour. 
Leaves were also used in combination with bark to making the thatching for shelters. 
Bardi grubs found living in the trunk of the Blackboy were eaten, and gum exuded from the floral stems was made into cakes. 
Gum or resin from the trunk being used to fasten the stone or glass spearheads to the shaft of spears.', conservation: '
Kingia, like Xanthorrhoea, live for a very long time (centuries) and have very slow growth rates. Aging these plants is possible (though destructive) by removing the leaf-bases and aerial roots and examining the core of the trunk. This core has waves and each wave has been found to correspond to a year\'s growth. Quicker though, you can measure the diameter and by knowing that growth of the stem is roughly 1.5 cm / year, you can calculate its age. Prolific flowering creates a pattern in the trunk and when seen on very old specimens (400 years old) this provides us with a unique insight into the bush ecology. From a specimen in Roleystone (a hill suburb of Perth) it was ascertained that fires rarely occurred in the 200 years prior to European settlement.

Kingia survive bush fires well due to their thick outer leaf-base trunk. Flowering is stimulated and quick flower growth occurs (the onset of flowering within 3 weeks).

The aerial roots seen on Kingia are unusual, such an adaptive feature tends to suggest that Kingia previously inhabited more wet, moist environments such as rainforests. Today Kingia grows in drier areas, environmental conditions changing dramatically ............ These roots are produced at the onset of winter and descend down the trunk underneath the leaf-bases (inside the leaf base ring, so they are not visible). They grow 2cm a month during the growing season and send out laterals roots. Some enter the soil upon where they grow directly downward. 
It is thought that these roots are advantageous to the plant in many ways; 
Obviously if the plant is growing in water or waterlogged sites these roots help to take up oxygen (this explains why such specimens grow well), the fine roots which entertwine within the leaf bases and may absorb water that collects here after short summer and autumn showers which are not heavy enough to substantially wet the soil. 
Nutrients are probably also extracted in a similar manner from decaying organic matter such as leaves or bird droppings, which happen to reside on the leaf-base trunk. 
These roots may also play a role in the longevity of this plant via physical protection, such as in situations when the leaf-bases rot away (with old age) the compact mesh of roots protects the fibrous core from fire and insects. 
Mechanically speaking these roots may also help to stabilise the trunk of the plant especially when the trunk\'s soft fibrous core dies back (after 300 or 400 years). During this time the plant is able to live purely through the connection these roots make with the soil. 
Additionally this plant, if knocked over, will grow new roots from its trunk (aerial roots) into the soil and continue to survive.', wildlife: 'Attracts:

However it seems to prefer better class (more fertile) well-drained soils, as it is found combining with jarrah and yarri in the forests on the Darling Range. Marri is absent from the Wandoo forests and hence we can assume it doesn\'t favour heavy-clay soils. It is generally found in the higher rainfall areas.', additional_info: 'The specific name \'calophylla\', Greek for \'with beautiful leaves\', relating to its foliage and to its similar nature to the tropical plant genus Calophyllum. Named first by Robert Brown who was the botanist accomanying the Flinders in 1801-1802. Note however that Brown did not validly publish the name and it was later described by John Lindley in 1841 (by the collection). 
Collected in 1839 at Augusta by Georgiana Molloy, a pioneer settler, who collected local species and sent pressings to England for classification and further study. 
The common name of Red gum, referring to the grouping of C. calophylla with the \'bloodwoods\', which exude dark red gum. Red gum being the common name used by early settlers (1838), but the Swan River Aborigines called it N\'gumbat. Other Aboriginal names included Kurden, or Karden and Marri or Marree. C.E. Lane-Poole (a former Conservator of Forests) advocated the use of Marri as the common name to minimise confusion with Red Gum or E. camaldulensis, or River Red Gum of Victoria and South Australia. 
Native range extending from Port Gregory near the Murchison River to Cape Riche, westward and southward to the coast and inland just beyond the limits of the Jarrah zone, reaching Tincurrin.', identification: 'Leaves are smooth, green to dark-green above, pale below, viens are at 50-70 degrees to the midrib and densely packed. Juvenile leaves are ovate-lanceolate, mature leaves are broadly lanceolate, mostly straight, 10-12cm long and 2.5-4.5cm wide, petiole 2cm. Flowers, creamy-white, are held in branching stems above the foliage. Flowers are terminal, corymbose panicle to 12cm across, consisting of umbels of about 5-7 flowers (some naturallay occurring forms flower pale pink). Club-shaped buds (to 1.3cm long) on long slender stems have small rounded bud caps often with a blunt point. Easily identified by the large clusters of fruits (often referred to as \'honkey nuts\') which weigh down the branches after flowering. Fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule to 4cm long and as wide, reducing to 2cm across the prominently raised rim (constricted neck), the valves are deeply sunken. Seed from the nuts is larger than any other eucalypt and is not retained in the fruit capsule but is shed. 
Note it can be easily distinguished from jarrah E. marginata which has long fissured bark, as opposed to its blocky rough bark. The conspicuous terminal clusters of flowers and fruits of C. calophylla are typical of the bloodwoods, a primitive group of what used to be called eucalypts. Their leaves have distinctive parallel viens (nearly at right angles with the midrib) and are held with the upper-side up not edge-up as in most eucalypts. The only other bloodwood on the coastal plain, which has these features is Eucalyptus haematoxylon, which is smaller tree to 10m. When not in flower is can also be confused with \'red-flowering gum\' E. ficifolia and \'mountain gum\' E. haematoxylon. It can be easily distinguished from \'red-flowering gum\' which has a smaller form, reddish-brown bark, denser canopy, darker green leaves, smaller and more rounded fruits, brown winged seed and earlier flowering time. Further it is easy to confirm the identity by holding a leaf towards the sun, and examining it for oil glands. If none are seen then you have identified C. ficifolia, if oil glands are present then you have either C. calophylla or E. haematoxylon. \'Mountain gum\' being a smaller more crooked tree with brown to red-brown seed.

Used by Aborigines to make spears, boomerangs and long narrow sheilds or \'mulgas\'. The seed and gum are edible. Seed is best eaten once ground (a very important constituent in the bush food diet of inland Aboriginal communities) and the gum which appears in large apricot sized juicy yellow fleshed galls after rains can be eaten whole (this gum is induced by insect attack). After substantial rainfall and profuse flowering seed production is high, transforming the bush to a more \'green\' colour (different from its predominant dull grey appearance). These \'green\' trees are sought after by the Aborigines. Pods are collected, threshed and then winnowed. It has been noted that seed is often soaked or roasted before being ground and consumed, however communities in the Ashburton region simply grind up their seed (known as \'wintamar\'), not bothering to prepare it in any way. The flour from the ground seed can be mixed into a paste and made into a damper or eaten raw. The bark can be burnt to ash and mixed with dried Isotoma petraea (rock isotome) and small amounts may be consumed to alleviate cold symptoms. Small waxy red growths (\'wama\') found on the branchlets or twigs can be collected up, crushed and mixed with water to make a sweet tea.

Collected from the west coast of Australia.', identification: 'Leaves are dark green (on both sides), alternate, linear-lanceolate, slightly falcate, 10-12cm long and 6-10mm wide (juvenile leaves broader than mature leaves); distinctly petiolate - petiole 0.8-1.3cm, apex attenuate; base cuneate; margine entire; 3 main longitudinal veins; leaves covered with transparent oil glands which produce a strong scent when crushed. Foliage is dense on slender zigzag-ing twigs, often forming a rounded crown. Inflorescence is a pubescent umbellate head of 10-15 flowers in the axils of the 1 year old shoots; flowers rotate, of 5 obovate petals to 5mm long with a narrow claw at the base, being 1.5cm across, pure white with dull crimson disc; stamens roughly 20, 1.5mm long in groups of 4 or 5 on the rim of the receptacle between the petals. Flowers lightly perfumed. Fruit is a sessile aggregated cluster of 6 to 9 capsules (5-8mm wide); capsules 3 valved (3-4mm across); seed is brown, minute and numerous.
Commonly seen in the Perth area as a street tree, pruned to a \'mop-like\' appearance. Occuring in parts of Swanbourne and City Beach, along the Swan River downstream from Freshwater Bay.

- low maintenance required. Moderately frost tolerant (to 0 degrees C), plants are tipped in severe winters. Lime tolerant. Tolerates Phytophthora cinnamomi.
- minimal - some early pruning may be necessary to establish a single trunk (i.e. removal of lateral branches). 
- cutting - can be grown from cuttings using striking hormone (usually grown from seed though).
- seed - capsules mature in late summer to autumn, seed can be collected by tieing a paper bag over the immature capsules, seeds being shed soon after the flower dies. Mature seed which germinates readily, should be sown in spring (keep in a warm environment). Establish via direct seeding or planting out as a seedlings. 
- insect attack - the larvae of two species of jewel bettle (including Roe\'s jewel beetle) burrow into the stems, emerging to feed on the flowers.

The rhizome (tough, underground stem) common to most kangaroo paws, is buried 2-10cm below the soil surface allowing the plant to survive bushfires (sprouter). Also commonly seen occupying other disturbed areas (ie road verges).

Note that with regards to the inflorescence, only one or two flowers, open and function at any given moment (an evolutionarily advantageous trait to increase likelihood of successful pollination). Flowers opening from the bottom upward, with new flowers opening at night. Fresh flowers are thrust forward opening (usually) towards the scape (floral stem) on which pollinators (usually birds) sit. These flowers last for roughly 6 days then shrivel and rotate sideways, allowing the next flowers to open and face the stem. Pollinators are attracted to the brightly coloured flowers, being rewarded by often large quantities (250ul/flower/day) of sugar rich nectar (containing 5-20% sugar). As the animal (usually a bird) feasts on the nectar, pushing into the tubular perianth, it is dabbed by pollen coating the anthers (pollen production on this species is copious, anthers being up to 12mm long). These sausage-shaped pollen grains remain viable for only a day, but will hopefully come into contact with the stigma of another flower and seed will be produced.

This species is highly successful in attractive pollinators (highly successful reproduction) being found to have 50-70% of flowers pollinated and setting seed.

This genus protects itself from predation by herbivors through the production of calcium oxalate crystal (sharp-needle like crystals). Clusters of these crystals (called raphides) are toxic to most animals', wildlife: 'Attracts:
- birds, honey-eaters (the nectar produced during flowering attracts many honey-eating birds; including the New Holland, singing, brown, white-cheeked and tawny-crowned honey-eaters, silvereyes, weebills and red wattlebirds. While most of these species are successful pollinators, the silvereye and weebill (with their short bills) are known to cause flower damage in pursuit of nectar. Parrots such as the red-capped and Port-Lincoln parrot also destroy flowers, ripping them off the scape and crushing them to get at the nectar.)
- insects (flowering attracts an array of insect feeders; thrips, ants, bees, hairy catterpillars, long-horned grasshoppers. The european honey bee (Apis mellifera) theives nectar from the flowers and appears not to play a role in pollination (due to the large physical separation of the nectar site and the anthers and stigma). Often capitalising on damaged flowers caused by the silvereye and weebill (birds). The long-horned grasshoppers (Katydids) not only enjoy the feast of the flowers but also use the inflorescence as a site for mating.)
- mammals (flowering attracts marsupials; the honey-possum and western pygmy possum (small animals) which scamper up the floral spikes to drink the sugar rich nectar.

birds, seed-eaters 
Birds aid in the dispersal of seed. It seems likely that the brightly coloured (orange-red) seed stalks, displayed when the pod opens, attract birds such as silvereyes, red wattle birds and ringneck parrots. These birds eat the seed, digesting only the nutritious stalk, later excreting the seed. It seems likely that the occurrence of A. cyclops in places such as tuart forests has arisen from such a mechanism as many of these birds are known to nest here. Some bird species are not as useful as others however with the ringneck parrot choosing to break open the soft green seed pods to eat the immature seed.

This conifer when grown in coastal environments has a more rounded, spreading form than the predominant shaft like forms of most. Coastal specimens are typically smaller 5-10m tall, than protected specimens. Protected specimens are straight, sparser and reach 10-15m. It generally has a jaggered outline, with young specimens showing a flame-like shape.

Leaves are tiny, linear to oblong, 3mm long, rounded on the back, lying flush with the stem. Male and female cones exist on the same tree (monoecious). Male cones are small and inconspicuous (5mm wide) terminating branchlets, female cones are woody, globular, 2.5-3.5cm wide, warty in appearance, showing 3 large and 3 small valves (used to distinguish this species).

Callistris presissii is readily killed by fire. Regeneration is often poor due to its slow growth. The lengthy period required for maturation means seed abundance is also poor. Its populations have declined since European settlement. Populations on Rottnest Island are now being re-established in plantations.
Callistris presissii is long-lived with a life span of up to 100 years. This species is thought to be a local climax species (with regards to succession).
Seed released from the female cones are winged and dispersed by the wind.
Produces a resin that deters most insects. Note that the shaded protected environment of the thickets provides the ideal conditions for mosses and fungi to grow. Lichen being commonly found on the trunks and branches.', wildlife: 'Attracts:

Under such environmental conditions its branches form at wide angles and creates a dome canopy which often meets the ground (rarely re-rooting). Such dense foliage means that if the outer sections are killed by salt, the network of twigs below protects foliage behind. In undisturbed conditions the trees are found in close stands with a seemingly continuous smooth canopy. 
While it is a suitable plant for coastal positions we rarely see it in the Perth region today. With only a small population in the Yalgorup National Park, on an island in Lake Preston, and a small clump at City Beach (120m south of the car-park opposite the southern groyne).

Tuart grows closer to the ocean than any other Perth eucalypt. Salt-laden winds may alter their habit somewhat, reducing height and encouraging a lower spreading form. Limestone soils which they favour (being almost entirely limited in their natural distribution to Cottesloe soils) may also reflect similar changes in growth habit due to shallow soil depth.', additional_info: 'omphos meaning \'club\' in Greek, and cephale meaning \'head\', ie club-head referring to the rounded, swollen, overlapping bud cap.

Leaves are alternate, pedulous, lanceolate curved like a sickle, with a prominent midrib and lateral nerves spreading at a wide angle , the intramarginal nerve distinct from the leaf-margin. Buds are conspicuous club-headed (bud cap 10-12 x 8-10mm, being broader than the rest of the bud). Flowering occuring a year after the buds have formed. Flowers being borne in axillary heads, on a much flattened and thick stalk, supporting 3 -7 flowers which are stalkless. The calyx tube is bell-shaped, the operculum is hemispherical to ovoid-hemispherical bing much broader than the calyx tube. The stamens have yellow-white filaments. Fruits are creamy-white, sessile (stalkless), broad, smooth (or with one faint rib 2cm long), bell-shaped to cylindrical, 12-20 x 12-20mm. Many tuarts in the Perth area are scarred by fire (making their bark black) or heavy attack by insects (see ailments), both of which can make them die back extensively. 
Tuart has no known close relatives, notable is its box type bark and somewhat biolobed coltyledons. Pith glands are absent. Possibly confused with E. decipiens \'redheart\', being easily distinguished by referring to the buds, which are pointed, conical and sessile; depressed globular fruit, grey-orbicular or heart-shaped coppice leaves.

- Small, black, flattish to saucer-shaped seeds.
- Persistent finely fibrous, close, dense, grey to grey-white bark which extends to the branchlets, note however that smaller branches often stained brown. Tuart sheds more bark than most rough-bark eucalypts, leaving paler patches. In many cases (on the east side of the belt) they shed so much that the new pale bark predominates on the trunk (tuart\'s bark typical of Adnataria classifies it as a \'box tree\'). Note that scarring by fire makes the bark black. The timber is pale yellow.', horticulture: '- Tolerant of Phytophthora cinnamomi.
- Low maintenance required. very lime tolerant, usually frost tolerant needing protection when young
- Minimal: can be coppiced i.e. trunk cut at ground or near ground level to produce multiple stems for aesthetics, wind break purposes, for firewood or to renew vigour.
- Seed: seed can be collected all year round, with best establishment from seedlings
- Fungal attack: A bracket or pore fungus may be found on the trunk of tuart. The fungi growing up to 1m wide and weighing over 10kg.
- Insect attack: The larvae grubs of the tuart longicorn feed in the smaller outer branches causing brown stains where the sap flows from damaged bark. Grubs ringbark branchlets, causing the tree to re-shoot from lower down. The tuart bud-weevil destroys many of the buds. The female makes a hole in the cap of an unopended bud and lays her eggs. The larvea grow inside and eventually eats its way to the base, where it pupates and an adult weevil emerges.
- Readily available. commonly cultivated around Perth and South Australia, not common on the east-coast.

- Windbreak', culture: 'Tuart timber has an interlocked grain and was very popular due to its hard, dense and strong nature, being used to constuct railway wagons, stern posts, bridge supports and shafts. It is moderately termite resistant and even stronger than that of Wandoo (E. wandoo). However it doesn\'t occur in large enough areas to be viable for commercial production. The Ludlow Forest from which timber was collected in the past is now a National Park. 
Hollows (often used by animals) in the trunk and branches contain water. The bark of the roots can be eaten after scorching or pounding. This bark may be mixed with gum from Acacia species. Grubs found in the roots are also eaten. The nectar produced during flowering can be used to sweeten water which can be held in bark dishes. 
Tuart is popular for honey makers, although it\'s pollen is of poor quality, it creates a pleasing flavour, is light in colour and candies well. Production is often limited due to the destruction of many buds by the Tuart bud-weevil. Tuart leaves yeild 0.03% oil. 
The suburb \'White Gum Valley\' was probably named after the Tuart.', conservation: 'Tuart does not commonly mix with other eucalypt species except in northern parts of its range, occurring with jarrah and marri. To the south it is associated with Western Australian Peppermint trees Agonis flexuosa. Tuart forests are generally sparse in low growing shrubs and hence take on \'park-like\' appearances. 
Unlike many eucalypts, Tuart does not develop a lignotuber, relying instead on its bark to protect it from fire. Saplings sometimes shoot from a swelling at the base of the stem after fire, but often are killed. In the limestone caves of the south-west, tuart roots are often seen hanging through the roof or protruding from stalactites or stalagmites.

- Young plants have very rough bark. Mature trees having smoother bark which varies from ash-grey to creamy-yellow (sometimes pale salmon pink when new in autumn) often with patches and mottles of the old rough bark remaining. The youngest branchlets are powdery grey. The trunk does not reach much more than 1m in width.

- insect attack - a termite attacks the tree, hollowing out the limbs which then fall to the ground. They remain reasonably intact on the ground as dead wood is termite resistant. These hollowed out logs provide important homes for many animals (refer to wildlife). Wandoo is also attacked by boring larvae of beetles, often causing resprouting from dormant shoots along branches.

windbreak', culture: 'Famous as a source of nectar for honey, producing a mild flavour with excellent quality. As is prefers good heavy fertile soils it is often used to indicate good farming country and in many districts wandoo country was the firtst to be cleared. Honey supply thus being not as great as it previously was. 
Wandoo timber is light brown or yellowish-brown, close-textured with interlocked grain, hard and strong and is valued as one of the world\'s most durable timbers. Metal bolts and the wood create no chemical reaction, giving bolts longer lives for construction purposes. However due to the large amount of clearing of wandoo it is no longer a timber commonly used. The bark contains up to 12% tannin. 
The Aboriginies soaked the flowers in water to collect the nectar. They also collected water from tree-hollows (holes being carved into the tree and then closed again) which were located by discolouration of the bark. This technique being more common in the wheatbelt areas. The roots from this tree are not edible and sweet (known as Conna), this is in reference to another tree, Platysace cirrosa.kkk', conservation: 'Often growing in association with Xanthorrhoea preisii (grass tree). In the forest environment wandoo grows in a similar way to jarrah. Remaining as a low shrub for many years while its lignotuber develops. Later sending up a vigorous shoot to form a sapling, which grows to form a \'pole\' (minimal branching). At this stage of its development it has rough, flaky bark. The tree then develops in a less determined manner than most other eucalypts, with its crown becoming well developed, branches wiggling and turning.

- prune after flowering - Tree forms require little pruning except for in their early developmental stages, when pruning is required to establish a main trunk (removal of wayward laterals). Not only does pruning help alter the shape and growth form it also stimulates flower production (encouraging extra flowering - within the season and twice-yearly flowering). To get the best floral displays prune the flowering head before it turns to seed (during the final days of flowering or immediately after flowering). 
- cutting - short, leafy, semi-ripe tip cuttings taken in late summer and autumn. Note that cultivars must be propagated from cuttings to ensure the correct clonal features are maintained. Cuttings should be placed into a sand/peat mixture and kept in a cool, humid environment (with mist if possible). If difficulties arise in striking, a rooting hormone should be used.
- seed - seed in autumn or spring. Seed should be collected from the woody capsules near the base of the shrub, or closest to the trunk, to ensure seed is mature and viable. Capsules should be put into a paper bag and kept in a warm dry environment until the seed has been released. Seed should be sown in a friable medium and covered with fine peat and kept in a warm moist environment. Germination rates are generally high and therefore seeds should be sown thinly to avoid overcrowding.

Naturally found in a high rainfall zone (forests in the south, Western Australia) colonising wet road verges, river banks and swamps. It has been found living in shallow water (tolerates wet conditions), partially submerged during winter (tolerating brackish estuarine water). Is found growing in karri, jarrah and marri forests where it tolerates partial to heavy shading.', additional_info: 'Collected in 1803 at King George Sound by botanists Baudin, Guichenot and Riedle, associated with Thomas Nicholas Baudin\'s expedition. A. flavidus being named in 1807 by Augustus P. de Candolle (the Professor of Botany at Montpellier). 
The name \'kangaroo paw\' (initally called \'kangaroo foot\') came into common use in the 1950s, and is used to describe many species of Anigozanthos and Macropidia fuliginosa. The prefix \'Yellow\' describing the flower colour associated with this species, or \'Tall\' as it is one of the larger forms. \'Evergreen\' perhaps referring to the persistant foliage which is displayed throughout the year. 
The Aboriginal common names used to describe this plant range from, cattech, cathah or cassiteh and koroylbardang, though they are rarely used today. 
Naturally found from Augusta east to Two Peoples Bay and north to Waroona (Western Australia).', identification: 'In general flowers are yellow-green in colour, though they can be a more pronounced yellow, brownish-red (as seen in populations near Margret River), lime-green, orange or pink. The floral stem produces a widely branched cluster of inflorescences. Flowers have tubular perianths 3-4.5cm long, anthers are tipped with an orange appendage. Leaves are large and flat, 35-100cm long by 5-20cm wide (a distinguishing feature). 
Note that in the wild this species often produces twice the number of floral stems (10) in a flowering season than other related species (kangaroo and catspaws). In cultivation this number is often increased greatly (10 fold), given favourable conditions. Commonly the inflorescence is many flowered, 5 - 15 flowers per inflorescence (this species is known to be floriferous producing between 350 flowers per plant per season, note these numbers are often dramatically increased in cultivation, though rarely greater than 2,000 flowers in a season. Some of its hybrids being recorded as producing up to 7, 600 flowers). This species peaks in its flowering time in late spring or early summer. 
While most kangaroo paws have leaves and scapes (floral spikes) which die back post flowering, A. flavidus has leaves which persist throughout the year. These plants will persist in the same spot for several years (note many other kangaroo paws being thought of as biennial due to their poor yearly regeneration). Rhizomes growing larger than most species to 5cm wide. Leaf clusters of this species may exceed 2m in diameter and have been recorded as living up to 30 years or more.', physical:'- Attractive, reed-like, green foliage
- Showing large, yellow, furry, tubular, generally green- flowers. Flowers during November - February [summer].
used for cut flowers or floral art', horticulture: '- Often used as one of the \'parents\' of the colourful hybrids.
- Low maintenance required.
- Prune after flowering - cut floral spikes after initial flowering (low but not too low, leaving axillary buds) so that more floral spikes will re-shoot (extending the flowering time).
- seed - very easy to germinate from seed
- Fungal attack - susceptible to ink disease Dreschleria irisid , don’t over water
- Readily available. Very common and regarded as the hardiest species in cultivation. Popular cultivars (hybrids made by crossing A flavidus with another species)are listed below. Note that these can all be propagated by division, however on a large scale tissue culture is the preferred method. Cultivation is generally consistent in that most will thrive in an array of soil types so long as they have some drainage capacity, in full sun, requiring plenty of water in late winter and spring when the flower buds are growing. 
Tall cultivars (2m and over with floral spike) \'Bush Dawn\' also a cultivar of similar crossing (A. flavidus x A. pulcherrimus) is tall (2m and over - with inflorescence) which has long 120cm strap-like leaves with multiple branched flower stems (producing anywhere from 50 - 100 stems) with small bright yellow flowers in spring to early summer (spectacular display). This cultivar is a consistent performer and is suitable for temperate regions. \'In the Pink\' (also being a selected form) has a large form (2m and above with floral spike) leaves to 100cm, lightly branching stems which show off small hot pink flowers produced in masses in summer (up to 50 stems in a single flowering season). Flower stems have a reddish colouring to them. This cultivar is vigorous. \'Red Cross\' (A. flavidus x A. rufus) is a vigorous cultivar with a habit typical of A. flavidus. Floral spikes are multibranched and produce rich burgundy flowers (burgundy hairs covering the flower and the stem). Another cultivar \'Bush Sunset\' having the same cross (A. flavidus x A. rufus) this form is tall (2m and over with floral spikes) with long 100cm leaves which are much branched and produce masses of small bright red flowers in early summer. This cultivar is hardy and suitable for temperate regions. A beautiful cultivar which complements \'Bush Dawn\' contrasting in floral colour. Medium cultivars (1-2m with floral spike) \'Dwarf Delight\' (A. flavidus x A. onycis) is a popular apricot to red (burnt orange) flowering cultivar which grows as a small compact clump (1-2m tall with floral spike, spread to 50cm). Its multibranched flower stems to 1 m, flowering during the warmer months (spring and summer). Division of clumps may be difficult to re-establish, and appears to be susceptible to ink spot disease, therefore care is required when growing to get the best results. \'Regal Claw\' (A. flavidus x A. preissii) having olive green leaves with multiple orange flowers on spikes up to 1.5m tall (flowers and spikes being covered with dense red hairs), flowering in spring and summer. \'Pink Joey\' (a selected form of A. flavidus, discovered in the wild) has a compact clumping form (medium-sized 1-2m tall, reaching a spread of 50cm) with short strap-like leaves to 60cm, with small smoky pink flowers. Suitable to temperate and sub-tropical regions. Is a great potted specimen. \'Bush Gold\' is a medium sized cultivar (1-2m tall with floral spike, spread of 50cm) (a mutation of the hybrid \'Bush Glow\' a cross between A. flavidus x A. humilis) with shorter 60cm long strap-like leaves, with lightly branched flower stems bearing masses of bright yellow flowers in spring and summer, and sometimes sporadically throughout the year. This cultivar is suited to temperate and sub-tropical regions. 
Dwarf cultivars (1m and under, including floral spike) \'Harmony\' (A. flavidus x A. pulcherrimus) is a showy round clumped cultivar with bright green fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers on red stems to 1m tall flowering during spring and summer). \'Bob and Blanche\'s Wedding\' (a mutation of the hybrid between A. flavidus x A. humilis) has short (50cm) strap-like leaves growing to 60-70cm tall (spread to 40cm). Its floral stems are much branched showing medium sized bright orange flowers (nearly iridescent in colour). Flowering is year round in frost free environments (best grown in temperate regions). Large clumps will mulitply by division, often somewhat reluctantly. Makes a great potted specimen. \'Bush Ranger\' (A. flavidus x A. humilis) is a short form (60-70cm tall with floral spike, spread to 50cm) with 50cm long strap-like leaves. Floral stems are much branched and bear masses of small bright red flowers year round when not exposed to frost (best in temperate regions). Requires well drained soil to thrive as it is prone to root-rotting fungus Pythium (may need treatment with fungicide \'Ridomil\'). A good rockery specimen. \'Yellow Rock\' (a mutation from the hybrid cross of A. flavidus x A. humilis) (reaching 60-70m tall spread of 40cm) with short 50cm long strappy-leaves and many branched flower stems bearing medium-sized yellow flowers (sometimes tinged orange) year round (if frost free, suitable for temperate regions). Makes a good potted specimen. \'Bush Twilight\' (a deliberate hybrid between A. \'Bush Ranger\' x A. humilis) is a short (to 80cm tall, spread of 30cm) form with leaves to 50cm and lightly branching floral stems showing large yellow flowers tinged with orange produced on mass year round in frost free environments (best in temperate regions). Best as a potted specimen it is yet to be a reliable garden plant. Propagation by division is usually difficult. \'Bush Heritage\' (a deliberate hybrid between A. \'Bush Ranger\' x A. \'Bounty\' ) has a short form (60-70m tall, spread 40cm) with 50cm long leaves with a lightly branched floral stem showing masses of deep burgandy flowers (extremely floriferous cultivar). Flowering year round in frost free environments (temperate regions). It makes a great potted specimen, but is yet to be a reliable garden plant. Propagation by division is generally difficult.', architectural_uses: '- ornamental plant

- waterside position', culture: 'Apparently Aborigines would eat the rhizomes of young plants (prior to flowering).', conservation: 'A fire opportunist, appearing in great numbers after fires. The rhizome (tough, underground stem) common to most kangaroo paws, is buried 2-10cm below the soil surface allowing the plant to survive bushfires (sprouter). Also commonly seen occupying other disturbed areas (ie road verges). A. flavidus being extremely competitive, and seen in abundance in the south-west region.

Note that with regards to the inflorescence, only one or two flowers, open and function at any given moment (an evolutionarily advantageous trait to increase likelihood of successful pollination). Flowers opening from the bottom upward, with new flowers opening at night. Fresh flowers are thrust forward opening (usually) towards the scape (floral stem) on which pollinators (usually birds) sit. These flowers last for roughly 6 days then shrivel and rotate sideways, allowing the next flowers to open and face the stem. Pollinators are attracted to the brightly coloured flowers, being rewarded by often large quantities of sugar rich nectar (containing 5-20% sugar). As the animal (usually a bird) feasts on the nectar, pushing into the tubular perianth, it is dabbed by pollen coating the anthers. These sausage-shaped pollen grains remain viable for only a day, but will hopefully come into contact with the stigma of another flower and seed will be produced.

This species is highly successful in attractive pollinators (highly successful reproduction) being found to have 97% of flowers pollinated and setting seed (such high rates are due partially to its ability to self-pollinate).

This genus protects itself from predation by herbivors through the production of calcium oxalate crystal (sharp-needle like crystals). Clusters of these crystals (called raphides) are toxic to most animals', wildlife: 'Attracts:
- birds, honey-eaters 
(the nectar produced during flowering attracts many honey-eating birds; including the New Holland, singing, brown, white-cheeked and tawny-crowned honey-eaters, silvereyes, weebills and red wattlebirds. While most of these species are successful pollinators, the silvereye and weebill (with their short bills) are known to cause flower damage in pursuit of nectar. Parrots such as the red-capped and Port-Lincoln parrot also destroy flowers, ripping them off the scape and crushing them to get at the nectar.)
- insects 
flowering attracts an array of insect feeders; thrips, ants, bees, hairy catterpillars, long-horned grasshoppers. The european honey bee (Apis mellifera) theives nectar from the flowers and appears not to play a role in pollination (due to the large physical separation of the nectar site and the anthers and stigma). Often capitalising on damaged flowers caused by the silvereye and weebill (birds). The long-horned grasshoppers (Katydids) not only enjoy the feast of the flowers but also use the inflorescence as a site for mating.
- mammals 
flowering attracts marsupials; the honey-possum and western pygmy possum (small animals) which scamper up the floral spikes to drink the sugar rich nectar. Kangaroos (western grey) are also known to graze on the flowers, and often cause damage to plants by knocking down the scapes.', architectural_info: 'spectacular spikes of paw flowers for long periods', characteristics: '- clump forming
